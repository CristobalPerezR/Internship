1.  I had to change the names of foldiers from "_TESS_lightcurves_median_after_detrended", i just deleted the non star classification information. So if you want to check if the codes works, then you need to change the names to "ACV", "CEP", etc.

2.  I committed a little mistake on names i misswrite "Outlier" aside of "Outliner".

1. I refactored the large PDF files into foldiers with smaller PDFs.

2. I corrected the misswrite of "Outlier".
